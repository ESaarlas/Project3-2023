      <h2>#1. "Rooster (2022 Remaster) - Alice in Chains"</h2>
      <p>Alice in Chains' "Rooster," in its 2022 remastered glory, showcases the enduring influence of this iconic grunge band. The late Layne Staley's powerful vocals and Jerry Cantrell's distinctive guitar work truly define the band's sound, and this remaster preserves their legacy. Something I learned after doing more research on this song is that this track, originally released in the early '90s, is a haunting and poignant portrayal of the Vietnam War. Seeing them perform live last year is truly an experience I will never forget.</p>

      <h2>#2. "Self Discovery - Habe"</h2>
      <p>Habe's "Self Discovery" might not be a well-known track, but this emerging artist is making waves in the electronic music scene. Habe's innovative approach to production and introspective lyrics have caught my attention and kept it! According to Spotify, I have listened to this track a whopping 57 times in 2022. If you're looking for a new Spotify artist who is a true musician that has no problem pushing boundaries, try listening to Habe's "Self Discovery"!</p>

      <h2>#3. "Hold My Liquor - Kanye West"</h2>
      <p>Kanye West, one of the most influential and controversial figures in the music industry, delivered "Hold My Liquor" as part of his groundbreaking "Yeezus" album. The track explores the complex dynamics of a turbulent relationship, depicting the struggle to maintain a connection amidst the chaos of substance abuse. With raw lyrics, a palpable sense of vulnerability, and heavy layered sounds, 'Hold My Liquor' truly doesn't hold back in delivering a story of the emotional toll of love and self-destructive behavior. The guitar at the end...*chef's kiss*</p>

      <h2>#4. "Lemon Tree - Mt. Joy"</h2>
      <p>Mt. Joy, an indie folk-rock band, has been steadily making a name for themselves with their heartfelt and relatable music. "Lemon Tree" captures the essence of their sound, blending acoustic melodies with genuine, poetic lyrics. While they may not have reached the same level of mainstream recognition as some of my other top artists, Mt. Joy's music strikes a chord with those who appreciate authentic storytelling. A wonderful song to listen to on road trips with friends!</p>

      <h2>#5. "Go! - M83"</h2>
      <p>M83, the brainchild of French musician Anthony Gonzalez, is known for their dreamy and cinematic soundscapes. Most people are familiar with their "Midnight City" track, but "Go!" is a prime example of their ability to create euphoric, synth-pop anthems.</p>
