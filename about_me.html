  <h1>Hello! I'm Erik Saarlas</h1>
  <p>I believe that experiences shape who we are. My journey through life has taken me to various corners of the world, each step leaving a profound impact on my identity and aspirations. Born in Atlanta, Georgia on May 7th, 2001, my life's narrative began to take form with every move my family and I made.</p>

  <p>My story begins in Atlanta, but it truly takes off with our relocation to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in 2007. Those formative years in Ethiopia were instrumental in shaping my global perspective. Growing up in a developing country, I witnessed firsthand the realities of life in such an environment, an experience that went beyond what I had seen or heard on the news. This early exposure instilled in me a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and a keen awareness of the disparities that exist in our world.</p>

  <p>In 2012, I embarked on a new chapter as my family moved to Washington, DC. The capital city, rich in history and diverse cultures, further enriched my understanding of the world and honed my appreciation for the need to bridge gaps and promote unity. Yet, my journey was far from over.</p>

  <p>In 2015, we relocated to Jerusalem, Israel, a city of immense historical significance and cultural diversity. Living in Jerusalem provided me with unique insights into the complexities of a region filled with historical, political, and cultural intricacies. The time spent there broadened my worldview and deepened my commitment to understanding and working towards peaceful solutions in complex geopolitical environments.</p>

  <p>My pursuit of higher education led me to Chicago, where I began my journey towards a Bachelor's degree in architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2019. However, two years into my college experience, I realized my true passion lay in a different field. I made a pivotal decision to switch my major to ITM cyber security. I was drawn to this field by the urgent need to secure personal data and play a significant role in the fight against cyberterrorism, a challenge that resonates deeply with my belief in making a positive impact on the world.</p>

  <p>My diverse experiences living in various countries have not only shaped my academic and career choices but have also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the richness of our global community. I believe in the power of connecting with people from different backgrounds and in finding common ground to address the challenges we face as a global society. It's this belief that drives me to work towards a safer, more interconnected world through my studies in cyber security.</p>

  <p>In summary, my journey from Atlanta to Addis Ababa, from Washington DC to Jerusalem, and finally to Chicago has been a remarkable tapestry of experiences that has crafted the person I am today. My commitment to fostering international perspectives, embracing diversity, and actively contributing to a better, more secure world continues to be the driving force behind my pursuits.</p>
